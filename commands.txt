git init : initialise the working directory as a git repository, by default master branch, -b flag to specify branch name 
git status : status of the git repository
git add <file>... : adds the supplied file to the staging area
git log : gives us the commit history of the current branch
git commit : used to commit the changes, -m flag to specify the message(often includes issue number resolved)
