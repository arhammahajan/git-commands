staging area is that part of the working directory which git will track 
git init : initialise the working directory as a git repository, by default master branch, -b flag to specify branch name 
git status : status of the git repository
git add <file>... : adds the supplied file to the staging area
git log : gives us the commit history of the current branch
git commit : used to commit the changes, -m flag to specify the message(often includes issue number resolved), -a flag with no argument to add and commit simultaneously
# git creates a checksum for every commit so it knows when the data has been changed, shows only first 7
# first add the file to the staging area to track the changes and then commit the tracked changes
